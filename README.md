# Datathon5

Mobile health (mHealth) data, refers to the collection of information through cell phones or other wireless technologies. The widespread use of mHealth data enables remote, objective monitoring of health parameters, such as physical activity. Detecting the physical activity level has application for public health, patient-management, adherence monitoring in randomized control trials, and personal health goals. Our objective was to use deep learning methodologies and multi-dimensional time-series data acquired from wearable sensors to detect and classify human activities. To do so, this datathon uses acceleration and gyroscopic measurements across three axes for each location collected from wearable sensors placed on subjectsâ€™ left ankles and right lower arms.
